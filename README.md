This repository contains designs and source code produced as part of the Texas A&M Electrical Engineering 2025 Samsung Lime Treatment capstone project.

* The "403" folder contains initial prototypes that were created over the duration of the first semester of the project, from January 2025 to May 2025.
* The "ESP32" directory contains the full integrated firmware implemented on the core ESP32 microcontroller.
* The "PCB.zip" file contains copies of full PCB design files produced in Altium Designer for the project. This zip file is encrypted using AES-256, and the decryption key is provided as part of the project report. Please contact `hello at atenfyr dot com` if you do not have access to the project report but require access to these PCB design files.
